Feature: Single Node Cluster Preparation
  As a MapR Employee
  In order to test and demo Spyglass before it is available in the UI installer
  I prepare a Single Node MapR Cluster with the prerequisites documented in private/spyglass readme

  # TODO: Please see bin/install-mapr.sh, bin/install-spyglass.sh, DEVOPS-101 JIRA ticket, and lib/infrastructure

  #Scenario: Install on Docker Container
