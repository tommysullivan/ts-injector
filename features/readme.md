# Features

We use Gherkin and Cucumber.js to do acceptance / regression testing of Spyglass.

# To Do:

    - Rewrite the Installation / Configuration tab of the test plan into Gherkin and use Sheets Integration above.
    - Link google docs to the tests
    - Enable ability to override IPs without needing to modify tests
    - If a test is "manual" then it should automatically output "Passed"!
