Feature: Cluster Utilization

  Scenario: What is the storage utilization trend?
  Scenario: Do I need to add storage or compute resources? If so, when?
  Scenario: What user or group is consuming the majority of resources?
  Scenario: How is my cluster performing today vs. yesterday?
  Scenario: Are any resources (slots, RAM, other) becoming fully utilized? If so, what jobs, users, or tenants contributed?
  Scenario: Are some FairScheduler queues full while others aren't? This is in RM page but perhaps Spyglass can yield answers around which groups (queues) are more heavily used than others.
  Scenario: Dashboard with visualizations of containers, slots, ram, cpu, etc. Ability to drill down into what contributed to utilization - queues -> users -> jobs -> tasks
