Feature: Jobs Health

  Scenario: How can I quickly look at job logs for errors?
  Scenario: Why did a job fail? Was it an error in the code or an issue in the cluster?
  Scenario: Why was a job slow? Was the cluster fully utilized? Did the user submitting the job hit a quota? Was the queue full of another user's jobs?
  Scenario: Job specific logs and metrics for troubleshotting. User / admin puts job id into fields and charts appear for job metrics (containers used over time, transfer rates, other) as well as stdout/stderr for the job with ability to filter errors, warnings, or arbitrary strings.
